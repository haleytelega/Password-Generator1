Haley Telega's Password Generator

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password:

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

This is an example of how it should look like:

Disclamer:

I messed up my first resposity with all my commits and work done. Please reference https://github.com/haleytelega/Password-Generator if you want to look at my work that was done. It is all done in the password-length branch.
